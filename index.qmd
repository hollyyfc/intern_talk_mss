## Intern Experience {.smaller}

### Clinical Trials

👩‍🔬 **Biologists / Chemists**: discover potential compounds (1M+)

🐁 **Animal Testing** (1K+)

💊 **Human Testing** (100+) -\> Clinical Trials:

-   **Phase 1**: \~10 cases -\> 1st trial in human subject (safety)
-   **Phase 2**: \~100 cases -\> test out the best dosage (efficacy)
-   **Phase 3**: \~1000 cases -\> validating the results from previous phases
-   **Phase 4**: general population -\> after FDA approval, review public/hospital data

> Statisticians are vital to the development of new drugs, from study design to approval reporting!

## Intern Experience (cont.) {.smaller}

### My Work

-   Computational Stats ➡️ Diabetes \| Phase 3
-   Automate safety reporting pipeline with R Shiny app & SAS, ensuring consistency and efficiency
-   Review compound protocols and statistical analysis plans; understand study design (hypothesis testing, causal inference, hierarchical modeling, etc); data cleaning / pre-processing / EDA / analysis / visualization (TFL)

## Tips

-   Highly regulated industry: require interpretability and reproducibility
-   Master (computational: heavy programming) vs. PhD (study design: more math)
-   Play to your advantage in stats (over biostat/CS/math)

## Application Timeline

-   `Dec 2023`: Submit application
-   `Mid Jan 2024`: HR reach out
-   `Late Jan 2024`: Interview (yes just one round)
